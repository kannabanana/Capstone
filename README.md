Welcome to our (Kanna, Garrett, and James - Team 36) capstone project readme! 

ABOUT:
 OSU’s Energy Efficiency Center helps manufacturing and industrial companies reduce their energy footprint. This is accomplished by producing reports about energy trends and making recommendations based on them. The reports, projects, and other data are maintained in their internal website. 

The website has been developed by different programmers and as a result has become disorganized and difficult to update. In order to remedy these issues we will design a secure, user friendly website with good code practices for the Energy Efficiency Center. Furthermore, the website is not accessible from mobile devices which decreases productivity of workers who can’t access the website while on the job site. We aim to create a website that is mobile accessible (stretch goal) and friendly for increased accessibility.
